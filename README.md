# Verbatim

This Rust crate provides an extension trait, `PathExt`, for converting a
`std::path::Path` to a verbatim path.

# Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).
The maintainer of `verbatim`, Dave Herman, personally promises to work actively to uphold that code of conduct.
We aim to foster a community that is welcoming, inclusive, empathetic, and kind.
If you share those goals and want to have a ton of fun playing with Rust, we hope you will contribute!
